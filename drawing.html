<h1>What is drawing?</h1>
<p>Drawing is an artform that is created usually using a writing utensil such as a pencil 
or pen and dragging it against a surface such as paper, creating lines. Drawings are usually
where most people start for creating art in different mediums. (EX: If you were going to 
paint a picture, usually you would sketch it out before painting.)</p>
<h2>How do I get started?</h2>
<p>The great thing about drawing is that you don't really need to go out and buy a bunch
of specialized materials to practice. Most people already have pencils (or another writing
utensil) around their house as well as some paper. The main key to becoming a skilled in 
drawing is to never stop practicing and looking for ways to improve. There are also plenty
of resources if you look around- websites like YouTube have tutorials if you don't feel
like leaving the house, or if you have an art center in your local area- most of the time
they offer basic art classes to teach drawing techniques.</p>
