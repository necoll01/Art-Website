<p>Sculpture By Ossip Zadkine (Date Unknown)</p>
<h1>What is sculpture?</h1>
</header>

<main>
<p>Sculpting is a three-dimensional art form that involves using materials such as 
clay, wood, wire, or even cardboard. Chances are, you have already sculpted and don't even
realize it! If you have ever played with Play-doh, then you already have sculpting experience.</p>

<p>If you wanted something that holds up a little better than Play-doh though, they make 
very affordable craft clay to get started that you can purchase at your local craft store.
The great thing about sculpture is that it is often abstract, meaning it is no discernable
idea or object! So shape until you see one you like. Tools like forks and spoons can help
you make textures early on. Good luck!</p>
