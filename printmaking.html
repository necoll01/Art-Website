<h1>What is printmaking?</h1>

	<p>Printmaking is defined as the art of making prints. One of the most accessible form of 
printmaking for modern artists is called linocut. Linocut is done by carving a sheet of 
linoleum with a linocut tool. The parts that you do not want to show up on the paper you 
must carve deeply so that part of the linoleum does not touch the paper when you essentially 
stamp it onto paper. After you are done carving you must roll ink onto your linoleum with 
an ink roller and stamp it onto paper evenly. </p>

<h2>How do I start printmaking?</h2>

	<p>The easiest way to start printmaking is to watch a few tutorials to get a better idea
for the entire process, and then head down to your local art store and pickup 
some linoleum, a linocut tool, printmaking ink, paper and an ink roller. The employees at the 
art store should be able to help you decide which tools are best for you as a brand new 
printmaker. Just remember to have fun and carve away from yourself!</p>
