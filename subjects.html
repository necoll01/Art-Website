<h1>Subjects</h1>
<p>When creating art there is always the question every artist asks themselves: what is 
this going to be? By definition, that would be the subject of your art. Most people 
have a system for deciding, but sometimes you may need a little help! Here are some tips 
on choosing the subject of your next visual art piece:</p>
<ul>
<li>Look into your daily life, what makes you happy from day to day? What interests you
the most? Usually the things you are the most passionate about are the things that you
put the most work into!</li>
<li>Stumped for ideas? You may have a case of artist's block! The best way to combat this
is to go and take a break. Get some fresh air. Talk to people. Come back the next day and it 
should help refresh your creative senses!</li>
<li>Check out your local library, they probably have books with drawing exercises for beginners, 
so you can figure out what you like to do best AND learn from the pros at the same time!</li>
