<h1>If you were to want to try all of these methods of visual art out...</h1>
<p>A combination of all of these tools should give you a decent start into the world of
visual art! If you are on a budget though, maybe mix and match. You would be surprised 
how often you can use things that aren't necessarily made for art on a piece!</p>

<p>There may be people who would say you should buy the best of these things, but you will 
break tools, and who knows if you will even like some of these things? I personally would
save bigger investments for down the road! Something I wish someone would've told me is that
getting the highest possible quality of art supplies doesn't improve skill.</p>
