<h1>What is Painting?</h1>
</header>

<main>
<p>Painting is a two-dimensional art form that uses a pigment across a flat surface to 
create an image, most commonly with paint and a paint brush. There are three general kinds
of paint: acrylic, oil, and watercolor. The kind you choose to pursue is up to you, but the 
easiest to start with is probably acrylic. It is cheap, readily available, and dries quickly.</p>
<h2>How do I get started?</h2>
<p>I always recommend reading up on any new hobby you start, or watching videos. But once you have
done your own research it is best to head down to your local art shop and get yourself a student-level
paint set for which ever kind you decide is best for you. Canvas that is pre-primed works best after 
you have chosen your paints. Just make sure not to hit it with any sharp edges, canvas 
dents easy. Go slow and have fun. Practice is the biggest factor in artistic success.</p>
