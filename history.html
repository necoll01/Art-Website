<h1>The History of Art</h1>

<p>Throughout history art has been used to communicate thoughts and feelings to people.
From fine art to propaganda posters, for thousands of years art has moved the people
of the world to feel inspired, sad, happy, and even angry.<p>

<p>It is important to realize the impact of art throughout history because the art 
that you can produce may have the same effects. Art can bring fame, fortune, shame, criminal
charges, and many other things. But that is the beauty of it. What your art does for you 
and the people around you is totally up to you. It is a great way to express yourself.</p>
