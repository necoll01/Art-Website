<h1>Connecting With Other Artists and Your Audience</h1>
<p>Well now that you have all of this beautiful art, what are you going to do with it?
Lucky for you, we live in the age of social media, where everyone is showing off the most
impressive parts of themselves to the internet. You could post your art on your Facebook,
you could start an instagram page for your work, or a twitter, just to name a few suggestions.</p>

<p>Many artists have local meetups and swaps, you could check your local area for these kinds
of events.</p>
<p>There are other people who take their new art and start promoting it to sell. The same 
sites can be used for these purposes. The biggest struggle for the working artist though is 
staying afloat, quite stereotypically. So make sure you really love it before you go making 
a career from it! Selling art on the side is a great way to test this without going on a 
ramen noodle diet.</p>
