<h1> Intro </h1>
<p>Welcome to Visual Art 101! This is a quick lesson on art and the types that you can explore 
if you are interested in discovering your creative side. A common misconception about art 
is that you have to have a natural talent for it to embrace your creative side. This 
is simply not true. If you have an interest and the time, you can be an artist regardless
of skill level.</p>
<p> There are many different mediums to explore when you become an artist. You could spend
a lifetime using different techniques to make beautiful art for your friends and family.
For the beginner though, we should stick to the basics. This will help you figure out
what you generally like and deem worth exploring further.</p>
